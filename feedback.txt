Hi group 2,

Good job on your simulations. An improvement could be to randomize the nodes on your ring.

Your grade for HW3 is 16%.

Comments:
+3% for the use of typed Akka Behaviors Model.
+3% for a clear documentation with explanation about your implementation
and how to execute your program.

Good job on your simulations. Your grade for the project is 20%.
